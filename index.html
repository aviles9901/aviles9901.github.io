                    <p> Hi I'm Alejandro,

                        I am a recent electrical engineering graduate from McMaster University. 
                        After completing the last 18 months of my degree online, 
                        I am prepared to take the skills I've learnt and share them with the world. 
                        My main interest is embedded systems as it allows me to combine my passion for both hardware and software in a meaningful manner. 
                        I'm looking forward to the opportunity to refine my current skills and to learn new ones. 
                        If you'd like to talk about anything technology or computers I'd love to hear from you.
                    </p>
